        <h2>The X-Files<sup>TM</sup> Collectible Card Game</h2>
      </copy-link>
      <p>Welcome to <b>The X-Files Collectible Card Game</b> Advanced Game. The Advanced Game incorporates many of the nuances of <b>The X-Files</b> television series and is designed for the more serious gamer and <b>The X-Files</b> fan.</p>
      <p>If you have not previously read the <b>Basic Game</b> rule book, we recommend that you read pages <hash-link value="4" /> through <hash-link value="7" />; these pages will give you an introduction to <b>The X-Files Collectible Card Game</b> and the game's objective. If you are proceeding to the Advanced Game after learning the Basic Game, go on to the <b>Game Setup</b> section on the following page.</p>
      <p>In the Advanced Game, you will construct your deck of cards for game play. This gives each player greater control over the outcome of the game than in the Basic Game, where players use Starter Decks.The Advanced Game will allow each player to cater their Agents and cards to the Skills and strategy desired. It will be up to you to help Mulder and Scully solve their current X-File.</p>

        <h2>Advanced Game Set-up</h2>
      </copy-link>
      <p>The <b>Advanced Game</b> is designed for two or more players. The game is won by the first player who identifies one opponent's X-File. Game set-up for Advanced Game is similar to that of the Basic Game.</p>
      <p>For the Advanced Game, remove all Keyword <b>"Killer"</b> cards (see <b>Killer Cards</b> on page <hash-link value="42" />). An explanation of all card types can be found on pages <hash-link value="48" /> through <hash-link value="63" /> of these rules. Agent cards may also be included in your deck for use during the game. They are shuffled into your deck and may assist for one turn (see <b>Playing Cards</b> section on page <hash-link value="14" />). Separate your X-File cards and place them to the side.</p>
      <p>In the Advanced Game, you will be <u>constructing</u> your <b>Bureau Deck</b>. Your deck must have a minimum of sixty cards but may have more if you like. Your starting Agents and the X-File do not count toward this minimum. You may choose any cards, provided no more than two of the same card are used. You may include Agents in your deck. An Agent from your hand can be used to help out for one turn.</p>
      <p>Pay attention to the <b>Cost</b> to play each card. Having many cards that you cannot afford to play can de detrimental (see the <b>Playing Cards</b> section on page <hash-link value="41" />). Note that you will probably want to create the Bureau Deck in conjunction with selecting Agents and an X-File. For additional Deck Construction suggestions, see page <hash-link value="46" /> of these rules.</p>
      <p>As in the Basic Game, select an X-File card.Place your X-File face down in a prominent place, as you may need to refer to it when your opponent asks questions.</p>

        <h3>Advanced Game Set-up continuedâ€¦</h3>
      </copy-link>
      <p>In the Advanced Game, you may choose any number of Agents you like for your initial <b>Team</b>, provided there are no duplicates and the sum of all Agents' Costs does not exceed 20.The Agent's Cost is a rating relative to each Agent's game value and appears in the lower right corner of the Agent card. Your Team should be a minimum of three Agents, but can be more. Each player is allowed to have the same Agent.</p>
      <p>Each player divides the surface area they are playing on into three sections: the <b>Bureau</b>, the <b>Fields</b> and the <b>Hospital</b>. Your Agents begin the game in the Bureau section.</p>
      <p>Create a <b>Discard Pile</b> face-up next to your Bureau Deck when it becomes necessary. This will be used for discarding excess cards and cards you have used. Should the Bureau Deck ever run out of cards, shuffle your Discard Pile to recreate the Bureau Deck and continue play.</p>
      <p><b>The X-Files Notebook</b> and <b>tokens</b> will also be needed for the Advanced Game. The Notebook is a checklist used to track information about your opponent's X-File(s). Tokens will be used to track certain information</p>

After adding the <icon-resource-pool />s to your pool, you may then purchase cards. Each card costs <b>1</b> <icon-resource-pool />. Purchased cards are always taken from the top of the Bureau Deck. All cards must be purchased at once. A player may not purchase cards and then decide to purchase more after looking at the cards purchased. Regardless of how many cards are bought, no player's hand may exceed seven cards (but can be less) at the end of a turn.</p>
      <p>To keep the Resource Pool and Conspiracy Pool separate, we suggest putting the Resource Pool in the Bureau and the Conspiracy Pool by your X-File card.</p>

        <h2>Conspiracy Pool</h2>
      </copy-link>
      <p>Each player's X-File also has a pool used to purchase cards played. This is called the <b>Conspiracy Pool</b>. Your Conspiracy Pool represents the resources your X-File has at its disposal. Conspiracy Points are used to pay for cards used by the X-File to oppose investigations. These cards have a <icon-conspiracy-pool /> or <icon-star-pool /> under their cost.</p>
      <p>Replenishment of the Conspiracy Pool happens primarily during the opposing player's turn. When the Investigating Player has finished creating <icon-resource-pool />s and buying cards during the Briefing Phase, all players other than the Investigating Player have the following options:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The player to the Investigating Player's left may choose to discard cards from their hand with an <icon-resource-pool /> or <icon-star-pool /> Cost and add this number of <icon-conspiracy-pool />s to their Conspiracy Pool. Thus, a card with <b>3</b> <icon-conspiracy-pool /> Cost could be discarded in exchange for <b>3</b> <icon-conspiracy-pool />s.</li>
        <li>After the player has completed turning in cards, they may buy cards. Cards may be purchased for <b>1</b> <icon-conspiracy-pool /> each. Purchased cards are always taken from the top of the Bureau Deck. Regardless of how many cards are bought, any player's hand may not exceed seven cards (but can be less) at the end of a turn.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In a multi-player game, continue to each player's left until all players have had these options.</p>

        <h2>Playing Cards</h2>
      </copy-link>
      <p>The system by which cards are played in the Advanced Game is different from the Basic Game. Each card now has a "<b>Cost</b>" associated with playing it. You must pay the Cost to use the card's effect. Other than Cost, there is no limit to the number of cards you may play. If at any time a player plays a card and then determines they can't afford it, the card is placed on the owning player's Discard Pile. When any contradiction arises between card effects and rules, the card effect supersedes the rules.</p>
      <p>Each card will have a <icon-resource-pool />, <icon-conspiracy-pool /> or <icon-star-pool /> under their <b>Cost</b> value. This indicates from which pool the cost must be paid. <icon-resource-pool /> stands for <b>Resource Pool</b>, <icon-conspiracy-pool /> for <b>Conspiracy Pool</b> and <icon-star-pool /> for either.</p>
      <p>Cards with a <icon-resource-pool /> may only be paid for by the <b>Active Player</b>.</p>
      <p>Cards with a <icon-conspiracy-pool /> Cost may only be paid for by the <b>Conspiracy</b>.</p>
      <p>Cards with a <icon-star-pool /> may be used by either force -- however, whichever force uses it must pay for it. See the <b>Pools</b> section on page <hash-link value="10" /> for further information.</p>
      <p>If a card has multiple effects, indicated by the phrase "Alternately" appearing on the card, the owning player must specify which effect is being used upon playing the card. They may not change to the other effect later.</p>
      <p>In addition, all cards contain <b>Keywords</b> and <b>Activators</b>. These often serve as codes indicating when cards may be played. See the <b>Keywords</b> section on page <hash-link value="17" /> and the <b>Activators</b> section on page <hash-link value="16" /> for further information.</p>

        <h2>Agent Cards</h2>

      <p>Agent cards contain a <b>Game Effect</b> in the center of the card. This is a special effect related to the Agent's significance in <b>The X-Files</b> television series. Each of the Agents you selected to begin play may use their Game Effect.</p>
      <p>In addition to your Agents selected at the beginning of the game, you may include additional Agent cards in your Bureau Deck which can be purchased to aid for a single turn. A purchased Agent may contribute as a normal Agent for most of your turn, however their Game Effect is ignored.</p>
      <p>Agents may only be purchased during the <b>Deployment Phase</b>. A purchased Agent is treated as an Active card. When you reach the <b>Debriefing Phase</b>, the Agent is moved to the Discard Pile. You may not use duplicate Agent cards. This means you cannot purchase two of the same Agents in the same turn or purchase an Agent you already have in play.</p>

      <p><b>CONSPIRACY</b>: May be played when your are not the Investigating Player. You may play these cards during another player's turn.</p>
      <p><b>All other Activator Words</b>: May be played only in certain circumstances. The Activator tells you where or when a card may be played or what type of card currently in use a card may be played on. Refer to the Keyword on the card in play to determine if you may play your card.</p>
      <p>On an <b>Adversary</b> or <b>Event</b> card, the Activator states what conditions must be met for the card to be used. On an Equipment card, the Activator tells you what section the Agent must be in to Requisition the Equipment.</p>

      </copy-link>
      <p>FBI Agents have access to an assortment of Equipment to aid in the investigation. To obtain Equipment, Agents must Requisition it. All Equipment cards state the requirements for Requisition in their Activators. Frequently, the Agent will need to be in the Bureau to get Equipment.</p>
      <p>The Investigating Player may pay for and assign Equipment to any Agent who meets the requirement on the Equipment card. Furthermore, Agents in the same Team (please see <b>Teams</b> on page <hash-link value="23" />) are allowed to exchange Equipment during this phase. Agents may not have more than one of any particular item, but may have as many total pieces of different Equipment as they wish.

        <p>Let's assume that Agent Mulder has taken 5 damage and Agent Kosseff 3. Both Agents are moved to the Hospital since their HEALTH ratings have been reduced to 0. {{ playerOne }} has placed five tokens on Mulder and three on Kosseff. He does this to show that Mulder has taken all 5 points of his HEALTH in damage and Kosseff has taken all 3 of hers as well. During the Healing Phase, {{ playerOne }} removes two tokens from Mulder's card because this permanent HEALTH rating is 4+. He also removes one token from Kosseff's card because her permanent HEALTH rating is 3 or less. Neither Agent may leave the Hospital this turn, as they must heave at least 3 HEALTH to do so. The Healing Phase is completed.</p>

      <p>At the beginning of the Case Assignment Phase, the Investigating Player places all Sites in the Field Section that he might investigate. The Investigating Player must also pay the Cost listed on the Site card at the this time. Note that a Site being placed on the table doesn't necessarily mean that the player must ever investigate that Site.</p>
      <p>All opponents may assign Bluffs to any and/or all Sites played by the Investigating Player at this time. See the <b>Bluff</b> section on the following page.</p>
      <p>Sites played by the Investigating Player but not investigated during the Investigation Phase are moved to the Discard Pile at the end of the turn unless a Bluff is placed under the Site.</p>
      <p>Some Site cards give you a choice between two Prerequisite skills you may use. You must announce which Skill you will be using prior to investigating the Site. Once you announce which Skill you are using, you may not change to the other.</p>
      <p>If you have two identical Sites in your hand, you may not use them both in the same turn.</p>

        <h2>The Bluff</h2>
      </copy-link>
      <p>Bluff cards contain the Keyword "<b>Bluff</b>" and typically hinder an investigation. Cards with the Keyword "BLUFF" may be played in two ways.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Cards with the Keyword "BLUFF" may be placed face down beneath a Site during the <b>Case Assignment</b> Phase by any player except the Investigating Player. Bluff cards played beneath a Site may be purchased for <b>1</b> <icon-conspiracy-pool /> less then the Bluff card's stated Cost. The Cost is paid when the Site investigation is attempted. A Cost can never be less than 0. You cannot gain tokens as a result of playing a Bluff card with 0 Cost.</li>
        <li>Cards with the Keyword "BLUFF" may be played as normal Conspiracy cards at full Cost.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Bluffs are designed to make the Investigating Player think twice about the chance of successful investigation. Any card may be placed face down underneath the Site. These cards do not actually have to be Keyword "BLUFF" cards (non-Bluffs played as a Bluff are revealed and discarded upon Site investigation). They may in effect be "bluff" Bluffs. Cards placed under a Site as a Bluff remain there until the Site is investigated.</p>
      <p>When a Site with a Bluff is investigated, the card is revealed immediately. All cards placed as Bluffs are revealed, regardless of whether or not they contain the Keyword "BLUFF". If a card placed beneath a Site does not contain the Keyword "BLUFF", the owning player cannot afford to pay for the Bluff, or the owning player does not want to use the Bluff, the card is discarded.</p>
      <p>If the Site is not investigated this turn, the Site will remain in play with the Bluff underneath it until an investigation is attempted or the game ends. An Agent Team that investigates a Site with Bluffs beneath it "activates" these Bluffs. They are referred to as the <b>Activating Team</b>.</p>

        <b>Skill Check Subroutine</b><br>
        Whenever a Skill Check is initiated, perform a Skill Check Subroutine. The Skill Check Subroutine proceeds as follows:
      </p>
      <ol class="list-style-type--lower-alpha">
        <li>Announce to your opponent the Skill being used, the amount needed, and the Skill level currently possessed by the Agent Team.</li>
        <li>Each Player may pay for and play cards.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The current Skill level may now be modified by cards played by each player attempting to successfully complete or foil the Skill Check. The Active Player has the option to pay for and play the first card. After this, cards may be bought and played by any player. Cards must be paid for from the appropriate pool by the player who owns the card. See the <b>Pools</b> section on page <hash-link value="10" /> for further information.</p>
      <p>Multiple cards may be played prior to one card being resolved. In these instances, the last card played is resolved first. Cards are played until all players decide to play no more. One type of card which can be played is an Adversary card. These cards result in Combat. See the <b>Combat</b> section on page <hash-link value="31" /> for further information.</p>
      <p>After a card is used, place it face up on your Discard Pile. Playing a card may initiate a new Skill Check Subroutine. If this occurs, resolve this new Skill Check before resolving the original Skill Check.</p>
      <p>Certain cards may have lasting effects. This will be noted on the individual card.</p>

      </ol>
      <p>If the Agent Team successfully meets the Skill level needed after all card effects and any additional Skill Check Subroutines have been resolved, then the appropriate effect is applied. This ends the Skill Check Subroutine.</p>
      <v-alert variant="tonal">
        There are two special cases when exceptions to the Skill Check Subroutine process occur. The first is during a Site investigation. During a Site investigation, Bluffs placed beneath a Site are revealed and resolved before any cards are played in step 2. See the <b>Bluff</b> section on page <hash-link value="25" /> for information on resolving Bluffs.
      </v-alert>
      <v-alert variant="tonal">
        The second special case is during Combat. In Combat, repeat the Skill Check Subroutine process by conducting additional Combat rounds until the Adversary's HEALTH has been reduced to 0 or all Agents have been sent to the Hospital.

This card forces {{ playerOne }} to investigate with only two Agents. {{ playerOne }} chooses to leave Scully behind, as she is only contributing 1 to the Site Prerequisite. {{ playerTwo }} pays <b>2</b> <icon-conspiracy-pool /> for the Bluff. The actual Bluff Cost is 3, but Bluffs played face down in the Case Assignment Phase Cost <b>1</b> <icon-conspiracy-pool /> less. {{ playerTwo }} now has <b>14</b> <icon-conspiracy-pool /> in his Conspiracy Pool. {{ playerTwo }}'s second Bluff is not an actual Bluff. {{ playerTwo }} placed the Site card "Cape Cod, MA" underneath the Site to discourage {{ playerOne }} from investigating it. The Site card played as a Bluff is moved to {{ playerTwo }}'s Discard Pile.</p>
        <p>{{ playerOne }} now has a BEHAVIORAL skill level of 6 (Mulder 3, Kosseff 3). {{ playerTwo }} does not want {{ playerOne }} to ask a question, so he plays the Adversary card "The Manitou Stalks His Prey". The Manitou card contains the Activators "<b>CONSPIRACY</b>" and "<b>MOTIVE SITE</b>". Since it is not {{ playerTwo }}'s turn, the "<b>CONSPIRACY</b>" condition is satisfied. The "<b>MOTIVE SITE</b>" condition is also satisfied because the "Aubrey, MO" Site contains this Keyword. {{ playerTwo }} may play the Adversary card. {{ playerTwo }} pays the <b>6</b> <icon-conspiracy-pool /> Cost and now has <b>8</b> <icon-conspiracy-pool /> left in his Conspiracy Pool. {{ playerOne }} immediately plays his Event card "X" which negates one Adversary. {{ playerOne }} pays the <b>3</b> <icon-resource-pool /> Cost and now has <b>2</b> <icon-resource-pool /> left in his Resource Pool.</p>
        <p>With {{ playerOne }} still meeting the Site Prerequisite, {{ playerTwo }} decides to play another Adversary. {{ playerTwo }} plays his "Good People, Good Food" card for <b>8</b> <icon-conspiracy-pool />. {{ playerTwo }} now has <b>0</b> <icon-conspiracy-pool /> in his Conspiracy Pool. {{ playerOne }} cannot negate this card and Combat is initiated.</p>

        <h2>Combat</h2>
      </copy-link>
      <p>When you encounter an Adversary which is not negated, Combat will follow. Unless an opponent plays a card which specifically allows him to do so, only one Adversary may be encountered at a time. Therefore, if opponents want to play more than one Adversary, each is resolved during a separate Combat.</p>
      <p>Combat typically occurs in two rounds. The first round is <b>Long Range Combat (LRC)</b> and the second is <b>Close Range Combat (CRC)</b>. Only one round of Long Range Combat occurs. After Long Range Combat, Close Range Combat rounds are repeated until the Adversary is killed or all Agents are sent to the Hospital. All damage inflicted during each round occurs simultaneously. Thus, it is possible for an Agent or Adversary to be removed by Combat and still inflict damage for that round.</p>

      <copy-link value="32">
        <h2>Long Range Combat</h2>
      </copy-link>
      <p>Combat typically starts with <b>Long Range Combat (LRC)</b>. Some Adversaries will attack by surprise or other special method involving the skipping of Long Range Combat, but this wil be stated on the specific card.</p>
      <p>Long Range Combat skill is listed on Adversary and Agent cards. A <b>Skill Check Subroutine</b> must be initiated to determine the damage done by the Agents and Adversary. See the Skill Check Subroutine section on page <hash-link value="28" /> of these rules. Add up all combatant's LRC numbers to determine the amount of damage done. Combat cards are now played and their effect added. See the Combat Card section of these rules on page <hash-link value="35" /> for further information. Also, add the modifiers of any Equipment which adds to Long Range Combat.</p>
      <p>Damage inflicted by Agents may be applied separately if there are multiple targets, however, each particular Agent's damage cannot be split. Damage inflicted by a single Adversary on an Agent Team is allocated to one Agent. Each player decides which opponent will receive the inflicted damage.</p>
      <p>An Agent is moved to the Hospital when his HEALTH rating has been reduced to 0. Any reduction that results in a negative HEALTH rating for an Agent is considered to be HEALTH rating 0. No negative HEALTH ratings occur. An Adversary is killed (and discarded) when its HEALTH rating has been reduced to 0. Some Adversaries will not have Long Range Combat ability, noted by an <b>N/A</b> listed as its LRC.</p>
      <p>If the Adversary has been killed or if all Agents have been sent to the Hospital, Combat ends. If not, Combat continues with <b>Close Range Combat</b> rounds.</p>
    </rule-page>
    <rule-page page="33">
      <copy-link value="33">
        <h2>Close Range Combat</h2>
      </copy-link>
      <p><b>Close Range Combat (CRC)</b> follows the Long Range Combat round. Close Range Combat skill is listed on Adversary and Agent cards. Again, both players may use Combat cards. See the Combat Card section on page <hash-link value="35" /> of these rules. A Skill Check Subroutine again must be initiated to determine damage done by both the Adversary and the Agents. See the Skill Check Subroutine section on page <hash-link value="28" /> of these rules. Add on the effects of any Combat cards. Also, add the modifiers of any Equipment which adds to Close Range Combat. Apply the results in the same manner as Long Range Combat.</p>
      <p>When all Agents are sent to the Hospital or de Adversary's HEALTH is reduced to 0, Combat ends. Regardless of the outcome of Combat, the Adversary card is placed on the owning player's Discard Pile after Combat completion. If Combat has not yet been resolved, repeat Close Range Combat rounds until the Adversary is killed or all Agents have been sent to the Hospital.</p>
      <v-alert type="info">
        An Agent with HEALTH greater than 0 may stay in the Field and is not obligated to go to the Hospital unless a card effect states otherwise. If they choose to go to the Hospital, they may not leave until they have at least 3 HEALTH or are fully healed. See the Healing Phase section on page <hash-link value="20" /> for more information.

        <h2>Tracking Damage</h2>
      </copy-link>
      <p>In order to keep track of damage, you will need some sort of token. This may be as simple as pennies added for each damage point received or removed for each point healed.</p>
      <p>One method is the use of six-sided dice. For example, Agent Mulder (HEALTH rating 5) received 3 damage in Combat. Place a six-sided die on his card with the 3 facing upward. This symbolizes that he has taken 3 damage and has 2 HEALTH left. Now, assume he takes another three points damage. Mulder has taken a total of 6 points of damage. Since an Agent's HEALTH cannot drop below 0, Mulder now has 0 HEALTH.</p>
      <p>Mulder is immediately moved to the Hospital and may not contribute his skills to any Skill Checks. Place the 5 facing upward. This symbolizes that he needs to recover 5 HEALTH to be at full strength. During the next turn, the die is changed to show 3 facing upward symbolizing the healing of two points, a current HEALTH rating of 2, but three points needed to be healed to Mulder to have full HEALTH. If Mulder leaves prior to having full HEALTH (remember that he must have a minimum of 3 HEALTH to leave), the die indicating his current damage sustained remains on the Agent card.</p>
      <p>Another effective method is the use of tokens, for example, pennies. Place a penny on the Agent's card for each point of damage they have received. These pennies are similarly removed as an Agent heals in the Hospital. Experiment and use whichever method you find most convenient.</p>

        <h2>Combat Cards</h2>
      </copy-link>
      <p>Combat cards may be paid for and played during both the Long Range Combat and Close Range Combat rounds and typically enhance or reduce the damage done. Some Combat Cards will have a <icon-star-pool /> next to the cost number instead of a <icon-resource-pool /> or <icon-conspiracy-pool />. This denotes that either the Conspiracy or Active Player may use these cards. The card must be paid for by whomever uses it (Active Player or Conspiracy).</p>
      <p>Each player may use as many Combat cards as they like, provided their Cost is paid.</p>

      <p>The player who played the Adversary has the option to pay for and play the first Combat card. After this, any player may pay for and play Combat cards. Combat cards are resolved on a last-played/first-resolved basis. The results are then applied to the specific Combat round.</p>

        <p>Combat begins with one Long Range Combat round. The Adversary "Good People, Good Food" has no LRC Skill and thus does no damage during this round. Mulder has 2 LRC Skill and Kosseff has 1 LRC Skill. Neither player chooses to play Combat cards. The Agents inflict 3 damage during the Long Range Combat round. {{ playerTwo }} places three tokens on the Adversary card, denoting the 3 damage done.</p>
        <p>Combat proceeds to the Close Range Combat round. Close Range rounds will be repeated until all Agents are sent to the Hospital or the Adversary has been killed. In Close Range Combat Mulder has 2 CRC and Kosseff has 1 CRC. Mulder also has the "Knife" he Requisitioned earlier which adds +1 to CRC. The Agents have done an additional 4 damage for a cumulative total of 7. The Adversary does 3 Damage. {{ playerTwo }} assigns the 3 damage to Kosseff, resulting in her having 0 HEALTH. {{ playerOne }} immediately plays a Combat card. It is the "First Aid" card which immediately heals 1 point damage at the Cost of 0 <icon-resource-pool />. {{ playerOne }} uses this to add 1 HEALTH to Agent Kosseff and prevent her from having to go to the Hospital. The Adversary now has 3 HEALTH left and Kosseff has 1 HEALTH remaining.</p>
        <p>Another round of Close Range Combat occurs. {{ playerOne }}'s Agents do an additional 4 damage and the Adversary's HEALTH is exceeded. The Adversary card is moved to {{ playerTwo }}'s Discard Pile. The Adversary still does its 3 damage. {{ playerTwo }} assign the damage to Kosseff, who now has HEALTH 0 and is immediately moved to the Hospital with three tokens placed on her card.</p>

          Site Resolution

      </copy-link>
      <p>If the investigating Agent Team still successfully meets the Site prerequisite after all cards have been played and resolved, they may ask the Directed Player a specific X-File Characteristic question as stated on the Site card. The opposing player must be able to answer this question with either a "yes" or a "no" answer. The Investigating Player may also choose to guess the opponent's X-File identity as well. If the identity guess is correct, the Investigating Player has won the game. If the guess is incorrect, a penalty is assessed. The penalty is that the player whose X-File was incorrectly identified may now ask a question of the Investigating Player. This question may be a specific characteristic question as indicated on the Site card just solved, or a guess of the Investigating Player's X-File identity. If the player guesses incorrectly, there is not penalty. After all questions have been asked, the Site card is moved to the Discard Pile.</p>
      <p>Examples of appropriate questions are: <i>"Is your X-File's AFFILIATION Alien?"</i>, <i>"Is your X-File's METHOD Violence?"</i> or <i>"Is your X-File's RESULT Death?"</i> You may not ask questions like <i>"What is your AFFILIATION?"</i> or <i>"Is your AFFILIATION six letters or less?"</i></p>
      <p>If the Site Prerequisite has not been met, the Site card is placed on the Discard Pile. After all investigated Sites have been resolved, any remaining Sites with no Bluffs under them are moved to the Discard Pile. Any remaining Sites with Bluffs under them remain in the Field section until they are investigated during a later turn or the game ends. Sites may only be investigated by the player who played the Site.</p>

        <h2>Multi-Player Changes</h2>
      </copy-link>
      <p>In an Advanced Game, there are a few subtle changes that take place when multiple players are involved. This section will address these changes.</p>
      <h3 class="text-decoration-underline">
        Briefing Phase Multi-Player Changes:
      </h3>
      <p>When each player has the opportunity to turn in <icon-resource-pool /> Cost cards to create <icon-conspiracy-pool />s, the player to the Investigating Player's left must do so first. After each player is finished, continue to the next player on the left until all players have had the opportunity to turn in cards.</p>
      <h3 class="text-decoration-underline">
        Case Assignment Phase Multi-Player Changes:
      </h3>
      <p>In a multi-player game, the Investigating player must now announce the specific opponent to which each Site question is directed. This is done by default in a two-player game as there is only one opponent. The Investigating Player may only ask the Site question of one opponent. Once a Site has been directed at a particular opponent, it may not be changed.</p>
    </rule-page>
    <rule-page page="41">
      <h3 class="text-decoration-underline">
        Skill Check Subroutine Multi-Player Changes:
      </h3>
      <p>During a Skill Check Subroutine, all players may pay for and play cards. The Investigating Player may only play cards with an <icon-resource-pool /> or <icon-star-pool /> cost. The Directed Player may only play cards with a <icon-conspiracy-pool /> or <icon-star-pool /> Cost. Other players who are neither the Investigating or Directed Player may play any cards. In the event, <icon-resource-pool /> cards are paid for from the Resource Pool, <icon-conspiracy-pool /> cards are paid for from the Conspiracy Pool, and <icon-star-pool /> cards are paid for from the pool which the card benefits. If the card helps the Agents, it is paid for from the Resource Pool. If a card benefits the Conspiracy, it is paid for from the Conspiracy Pool.</p>

      <p>Answers to all Characteristics and Identity questions are given in secrecy.</p>
      <h3 class="text-decoration-underline">
        Card Play:

      <p>In a multi-player game, cards must be paid for by the owning player. Players may not give <icon-conspiracy-pool /> or <icon-resource-pool /> to other players or combine funds to pay for a card.</p>

          Optional Rules
        </h2>
      </copy-link>
      <p>The following rules were designed to add fun and intrigue into <b>The X-Files CCG</b> experience. They are not part of the official rules and you may choose to play with any or all of them as desired. In order to use an optional rule, both players must agree. If either player objects, an optional rule may not be used.</p>
      <h2>Game Play and Deck Construction</h2>
      <p>The following two optional rules are designed to make game outcome more centered around game play and deck construction. Both may be used together or separately. These are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Upon successfully investigating a Site card, the Investigating Player may ask a Characteristic Question <b>OR</b> guess the opponent's X-File identityâ€¦not both.</li>
        <li>A player has only ONE chance to guess the opponent's X-File identity per game. If an incorrect guess is made, your opponent automatically wins.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Killer Cards</h2>
      <p>Some cards will have the Keyword "<b>KILLER</b>". These cards can permanently remove Agents from play. For game play, these cards are optional. Both players must agree to use these cards in game play. If either player objects, these cards may not be used. Killer cards can be fun to use, but they can also create serious game play imbalances.</p>
      <p>If you play an X-Files Advanced Game using Killer cards, another way to win the game is added. You can now win the game by permanently removing all opposing Agents from game play. This is still a rare occurrence while using these cards.</p>

        <h2>X-File Powers</h2>
      </copy-link>
      <p>The X-File Powers were designed to add flavor and strategy in selecting an X-File. They are optional. Both players must agree in order to use the X-File Powers in Advanced Game play.</p>
      <p>As your opponent gets closer to identifying your X-File, the X-File gains added powers to thwart the Agents. These powers are based on the specific characteristics your opponent knows. Prior to using any of these powers, the controlling player must announce the specific characteristic of his X-File that allows him to use a power. This might seem redundant in a two-player game, but has significance in a multi-player game, as all players might not have already identified the characteristic. Additionally, you can choose to announce a particular characteristic to all opponents and gain that corresponding special effect. The X-Files power gained with a specific Characteristic being revealed are:</p>

        <h2>Deck Construction</h2>
      </copy-link>
      <p>This following is a brief section on deck construction to help get you started with building your Bureau Deck. Remember, you may not use more than two of any particular card.</p>
      <p>The first card to include, and possibly most important, is the Site card. These cards are important, as Agents need to ask questions about the opposing X-File in order to win the game. In a deck of sixty cards, you will probably want to include at least fifteen Site cards. Site cards should be about one quarter of your deck. They should also be coordinated around your Agents' strengths. Your Agent Team will have some skills with a total much larger than others. The Bureau Deck should have a proportionally large number of Site cards that utilize these skills.</p>
      <p>All other cards fit into two basic categories: (1) Cards that help you. (2) Cards that hinder your opponents. The mix should center around your personal strategy or play style.</p>
      <p><b>Cards that help you</b>: These cards include Witnesses, Events, Combat Cards and Agents. Events have varied effects. Your will probably want more of these than any other card type. Witnesses usually add to a Skill Check. Combat Cards aid in Combat situations. You will probably want about an even number of these two cards but less of these than Event cards. In the Advanced Game, Agents can also be included in your deck to aid during one turn. While helpful, they tend to be expensive and you will probably only be able to utilize a few.</p>
    </rule-page>
    <rule-page page="47">
      <p><b>Cards that hinder your opponent</b>: These cards include Events, Adversaries, Bluffs and Combat Cards. Again, you will probably want to include more Events than any other card type. Adversaries affect opponents by inflicting damage during Combat and sending them to the Hospital where they cannot contribute to a Skill Check. Bluffs normally subtract from a Skill Check outright. At this point, you will likely need to decide the main way that you want to hinder your opponent. This can be through Adversary of Bluff cards. Whichever you choose, you will likely want more of these than the other. Combat cards can be used to increase the power of Adversaries.</p>
      <p>The final consideration is the Cost to play your cards. It is not wise to have many powerful cards if you cannot afford to play them. The proper combination of more expansive cards and less expansive cards will prove to be the most effective.</p>

        <h2>The Nine Different Suits</h2>
      </copy-link>
      <p>The X-Files cards are divided into nine basic suits based on how the card is used in the game. Before going further, it is important to note that many cards will appear to "break" rules defined in the Basic or Advanced Game. When any contradiction arises between card effects and rules, the card effect supersedes the rules. Most of the information contained on a card is common to all cards.</p>
      <p>Common Information on All Cards</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The <b>Name</b> of the card.</li>
        <li>The <b>Card Type</b>: Indicates the card's function within the game.</li>
        <li>The <b>Advanced Indicator</b>: If there is a yellow-green "X" here, it denotes that the card is used only in the Advanced Game.</li>
        <li>The <b>Card Number</b>: A unique identifier for each card in the set.</li>
        <li>The <b>Activators</b>: Indicates when this card may be played.</li>
        <li>The <b>Keywords</b>: Indicates what type of cards may be used against the particular card.</li>
        <li>The <b>Game Effect</b>: Explains the effect of this card when played.</li>
        <li>The <b>Card Cost</b>: Indicates the amount it will cost in Resource Points (<icon-resource-pool />), Conspiracy Points (<icon-conspiracy-pool />) or either (<icon-star-pool />) to play the card from a hand in an Advanced Game.</li>
        <li>The <b>Story Line</b>: Consists of a brief quote or phrase relating to the subject of the card, taken from <b>The X-Files</b> television series.</li>
